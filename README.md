## Features
- Node.js & React: Full-stack implementation for efficient image data handling.
- Firebase Authentication: Secure Google-based user identity management.
- Firebase Firestore: Persistent storage for tracking user credit balances and metadata.
- Zustand: Reactive state management for handling image processing flows.
- Axios: High-efficiency HTTP client for third-party AI service communication.
- Tailwind CSS: Modern, responsive design system.

## Usage
The application provides a seamless workflow for creating transparent assets:
- **Sign In**: Use the "Get Started" button to authenticate via Google. New users are automatically credited with 10 free points.
- **Upload**: Drag or select an image file. The system supports standard formats like JPG and PNG.
- **Processing**: The backend controller handles the conversion of the image to base64, communicates with the AI engine, and returns a processed PNG.
- **Credit System**: Each successful removal deducts 1 credit. Users can purchase more via the "Buy Credit" page.
- **Download**: Once processed, users can download the transparent image directly to their local storage.
